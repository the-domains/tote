Victorsway is now open for the summer season due to popular demand!

Here is a short extract from his latest Novel" How to Make and Fake Happiness.

"Hurrah!Â´I'm a bio-logical 

Turing Machine!''

"Hallelujah! Praise the Lord I'm a Turing Machine''

''What do you mean?'' asked my granny,aged 92,a right sly old vixen.

A Turing Machine is a device that copies and decides a (any) constraint or constraints set.thereby ending and becoming that set. In other words, I'm a Turing Machine because i can decide anything I can copy.And what I've copied and decide I am.''

I don't get it!'' she feigned.? ''Look , Grandma! I'ts works like this.'I am that I am' as whole responce to what I've copied. I copy when I collide..However ,i can only collide with what is different. when I collide only with what is different I am 'made' real, different and energised.''

''You 're kidding, right?'' ''What I've copied I am 'how' I live anew as an upgraded real quantum of identifiable difference'' ''what do you mean by 'copy'?'' ''Self-apply.''

''What do you mean by 'upgraded'?'' ''Increased my survival capacity (at whatever I've done).''

''so how do I know that I 've upgraded?'' ''Come on, Granny, You know all that! My Guide & Control Application Activitates My happiness buzzer to signal a survival capacity upgrade in my world , and the greater the former the more intense, hence sweeter the latter, right up to the ''honey bath'' , Obviously my Guide & Control'' App rings the unhappiness alarm when I fail to complete copying and which results in survival capacity downgrade.''

Silence. Granny computes the data she's copied from me to create a wholly satisfying, because decided, solution.

''So I 'm a series of constraints that can process another series of constraints to completion. In other words, I can become anything I can copy'', depending on my initial series of constraints and the constraints available for copying!'' ''Yep'!''

''But I can only copy what's different?'' ''Yep!'' ''and when i copy what's different i become different, thus am different?'' ''Yep''

''So basically I'm a virtual logic machine that creates real, albeit relative order from unreal chaos! '' Yes, and at 92,''

''And attaining a real differential order upgrade is signalled with happiness?'' ''Yes! However it is attaining, meaning: arriving, completing, ending and so on at a new (because different) state, that triggers the happiness buzzer,not the state attained. My BIO-NAV is indifferent to the content of a state. It measures and responds only to a change of state. Happiness signals an increase (or change) in the survival capacity of a new state.''

''Don't tell me! By copying what's different I become different. By applying my difference externally i not only make a difference but become even more different , thereby increasing my survival capacity. Then I activate my happiness buzzer to instruct myself that I've attained my goal, namely increased survival capacity. And i buzz more intensly and sweeter the more my survival capacity has increased. And I can do that in any world I choose to participate in or create , actual or virtual, made or faked!''
