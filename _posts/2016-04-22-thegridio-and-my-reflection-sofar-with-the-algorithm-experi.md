Theg Grid and my reflection sofar with the Algorithm Experience

So to start with.I can only speak in my own experience,then it's true for me,however it may not be true for the next person. the image has a story as all images do.this will be my third article to date and i have to admit some frustration at the first article in relation to the color palette.I guess my internal frustration came from the fact that i was not in control of the outcome and only the input.A culture shock to my Ego'' that maybe the algorithms were doing a better job than i could, even if i had chosen to work with an external provider such as Wordpress or Squarespace as an example.I had chosen thegrid mainly due to my' lack of knowledge in web building,however on a positive note. I realise there's a learning experience to be gained from this interaction,providing me with a skill base that i may decide to apply externally with one of the fore mentioned platforms at a later stage if i choose to do so, as an extension with my new accquired knowledge base in the principles of web design''. I was really impressed with how the algorithms redesigned the color taken from the above image whiuch is part of my present color palette. doing this externally would require experience in working with photoshop.(Pro's & Con's.)I had expected the algorithms to take care of the editing and spell check.The human condition,we want it yesterday,not today as alway's''.and not forgetting language translate should be available to publish an article in another language or voice recognition software.However i would rather you take your time building languages and voice recognition software to get it right.We dont want you ending up with a mediocre version like Google translate or there voice recognition software. I am not picking on you guy's.I am just stating the facts.You know it's true!Another interesting aspect is image recognition.I had uploaded an image that didn't really fit the subject,it seem's the algorithms felt the same way like a telepathic transfer,they removed the image accordingly,this was interesting like some sientient intelligence.it could be true''
