LANGUAGE PATTERNS

I have chosen the image of the black bird because i have been studying it's song and vocal patterns for many year's along with other singing birds of the Forest and Garden.

Having covered many different vocalisations and adapted my own vocalisation in a mirroring format during this time.speaking in my own experience,how can one clarify in a logical explanation,la Lengua de los Pajaro's.It's like learning a new language when we travel to a new destination.it's very similiar to human language and has a collective resonance.it's an art in itself that we have once forgotten.

Back to the Black bird.I have been recording some sound file's of different vocal patterns during the mating season. So i to put together a song from different tone's and then repeated it back to them at dawn,waiting for the day that one particular black bird would apply that new vocal pattern,this took approxamately the best part of a year,repeating the same pattern over and over,until one day a black bird started to sing it.He sang it so well that i was able to extend it, adding new chord's,which he delightfully incorporated in his new song.I decided to extend it collectively just before the break of dawn singing this song.It wasn't long before it was adapted collectively by the other black bird's within the study zone.Iinitially there was some confusion,since they weren't accustomised to communicating with human's,when this barrier was dropped,the need to embed was no longer required.they were now singing it without further introduction and are still singing it today.

Now the new born blackbirds have adapted to this song in it's third season. .one in particular had a mixture of the first song and his song. ,but during the last two week's he has been trying to adapt to the initial song in it full symphony,initially i could sense his difficulty at adaptation.However i am continuing to apply new chords as we go along much like humans do when presented with a new phrase in a foreign language.they now awake me at dawn with there new song.They seem to have a conscious awareness of presence.Some of my neighbour's were aware of the communication,they commented that the birds seemed to know of my presence and would sing on my arrival.just like dog's sometimes sense when there owner's will return as an anology to sense perception.

A fitter anology to providing instruction could be compared to the great behaviorist experiments of the early 1900's,when Pavlov triggered his dog's salivation,not through a deep understanding of there hunger,but by simply ''repeating a sequence of events over and over'',just as i did with the black bird,providing it with the same data again and again,until the code rewrote itself.
