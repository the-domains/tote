LANGUAGE PATTERNS

I have chosen the image of the black bird because i have been studying it's song and vocal patterns for many year's along with other singing birds of the Forest and Garden.

Having covered many different vocalisations and adapted my own vocalisation in a mirroring format during this time.speaking in my own experience,how can one clarify in a logical explanation,la Lengua de los Pajaro's.It's like learning a new language when we travel to a new destination.it's very similiar to human language and has a collective resonance.it's an art in itself that we have once forgotten.

Back to the Black bird.I have been recording some sound file's of different vocal patterns during the mating season. So i to put together a song from different tone's within there song over a wide area and then repeated it back to them at dawn,waiting for the day that one particular black bird would apply that new vocal pattern,this took approxamately the best part of a year,repeating the same pattern over and over,until one day a black bird started to sing it,he sang it so well that i was able to extend it, adding new chord's,which he delightfully incorporated in his song.Since i now had one singing.i decided to extend it collectively over the study area by walking the streets just before the break of dawn singing this song.It wasn't long before it was adapted collectively by the other black bird's within the study zone,initially there was some confusion,since they weren't accustomised to communicating with human's,when this barrier was dropped,the need to embed was no longer required.they were now singing it without further introduction on my part and are still singing today.

Now the new born blackbirds have adapted to this song comming into it's third season.i Have been studying lately with the offspring from the first black bird that adapted the song.one in particular had a mixture of the first song and his song, since January of this year,but during the last two week's he has been trying to adapt to the initial song in it full symphony,initially i could sense his difficulty at adaptation I continue applying new chords as we go along much like humans do when presented with a new phrase in a foreign language.I am now awoken at dawn everyday in spring with this song.They seem to have a conscious awareness of presence.Some of my neighbour's were aware of the communication,they commented that the birds new when i was at home or not and would sing on my arrival.just like dog's sometimes sense when there owner's will return as an anology to sense perception.La lengua de los pajaro's'' Short stories''
