<p>LANGUAGE PATTERNS</p><p>I have chosen the image of the black bird because i have been studying it's song and vocal patterns for many year's along with other singing birds of the Forest and Garden.</p><p>Having covered many different vocalisations and adapted my own vocalisation in a mirroring format during this time.speaking in my own experience,how can one clarify in a logical explanation,la Lengua de los Pajaro's.It's like learning a new language when we travel to a new destination.it's very similiar to human language and has a collective resonance.it's an art in itself that we have once forgotten.</p><p>Back to the Black bird.I have been recording some sound file's of different vocal patterns during the mating season.
